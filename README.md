# Assignments
All my programming college work.
## What the letters mean:
#### A###
**A** for assignment, these are my key weekly assignments which are manadatory. Usually I have different `.cs` files for multiple programs, and I go into Properties to change the startup object to my desired program.
#### L###
I don't actually know what the **L** stands for, it's just what my teacher uses, but these are some extra non-mandatory tasks that I'm able to do.
